#### idea

hey, that looks fun.

What if we set up a Naive Bayes model to compute the probability that some object followed a particular trajectory, given a bunch of detector measurements made from different locations at different times?

With sufficiently extreme assumptions we can force it into the form of an LP.

#### disclaimer

this doesnt' work particularly well, but it is sort of entertaining.


#### example
